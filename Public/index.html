 Description: This is the HTML file for my Dice Roller it has the links to the JS and CSS files it uses and also the button with autofocus the user has to roll the dice. It also runs when the page is first loaded.
It displays the Attacks 3 dice and the Defenders 2 Dice. Also it displays who won the turn depending on the dice each play got.
